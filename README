Two modes -

Normal: Replace all instances of the word under the cursor in the current file.
Visual: Replace all instances of the current selection in the current file.

Usage -

<Leader><Leader>r

I may make the usage more general in the future, but it should be very easy to change this mapping in the script if you need to for now.

History -

I couldn't find a 'dumb' find and replace plugin. All the plugins I came across were function-aware, etc. This is great if you're using C, however, sometimes you just want to change some text.
